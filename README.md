# BizCardX-Image-Processing
BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with easyOCR

# Project Discription:

  This task with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.
  
  To achieve this, you will need to use Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL. The application should have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading thebusiness card image and extracting its information. The extracted information should be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users should be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button. And Allow the user to Read the data,
Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit UI This project will require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It will also require you to carefully design and plan the application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Good documentation and code organization will also be important for this project.

# Result:
  The result of the project would be a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).

  The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able
to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information. The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button.

  The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management. It would also require careful design and planning of the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible. Good documentation and code organization would also be important for the project.
Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals who need to manage business card information efficiently.
